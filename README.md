# S3R File System

## Simple file system implementation that uses a file to store the internal structures and data
---
### Build instructions

go into the directory containing code files, execute 

`./build.sh` 

executable file `a.out` is generated.

---
### Running instuctions

`./a.out <filename_to_store_the_fs>`

For example after building the code if you execute
`./a.out s3r.fs`

This creates a filesystem in the current folder named **"s3r.fs"**. After executing this command please follow on screen instructions.

*For next executions please use the same name("s3r.fs") to use the same filesystem if you want to get the saved contents.*
